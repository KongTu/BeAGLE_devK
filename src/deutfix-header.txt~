C     This subroutine compensates for a flaw in the handling of 
C     deuteron beams. BeAGLE (DPMJET) treats a deutron as a pair
C     of on mass-shell nucleons with momentum pF and -pF (3-vector) 
C     in the ion rest frame. But this violates energy conservation
C     in this frame (4-momentum in general) since the n+p already
C     have more energy than the deuteron (which is bound!) and any
C     relative momentum between p + n only compounds the problem.
C
C     For larger nuclei, there is a mean field potential which reduces
C     the energy of outgoing nucleons as well as a nuclear remnant to
C     absorb any remaining 4-momentum imbalance. 
C
C     This routine should be called in the ion rest frame, and currently
C     only for deuterons.
C
C     The goal here is to scale all momenta in the ion rest frame, 
C     including the spectator by a common factor ASCALE so that the 
C     Energy is correct. The momenta should add up to zero and will be 
C     unaffected by the scale factor.
C
C     For 2 particles there is a reasonable exact formula.
C     For 3 particles the exact formula is really complicated.
C     For >3 particles I don't believe there is a closed form solution.
C     Therefore we'll use an iterative procedure which assumes that
C     ASCALE ~ 1. For N=2, the 1st step of the procedure uses the exact
C     formula and should therefore converge immediately.
